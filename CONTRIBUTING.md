## Adding a New Cleanup Category

All categories are defined in `MacCleanup/CleanupCategory.swift`.

Add a new entry to the `all` array:

```swift
CleanupCategory(
    name: "Your Tool Cache",
    icon: "folder",           // SF Symbol name
    paths: ["~/Library/Caches/com.yourtool"],
    shellCommand: nil         // or a shell command string if needed
),
```

- `paths` — use `~` for home directory, supports multiple paths per category
- `shellCommand` — use this when deletion requires a CLI command (e.g. `docker system prune -f`)
- `icon` — any [SF Symbol](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) name
